                <p>I am a senior at Centennial High School, and I will be graduating at the top of my class. I am the president
                    of my school's Business Professionals of America (BPA) Chapter. I am also an Intern Web Applications Developer
                    at Idaho Digital Learning Academy. I develop JAVA and PHP-based server-side web applications to complement
                    online education in the state of Idaho. My most meaningful achievement so far was when I placed 2nd for C++
                    Programming and 6th for Computer Programming Concepts at the BPA National Leadership Conference in Orlando, Florida.
                    I have also participated in and won several other extra-curricular activities and competitions. Details can be
                    found on my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/deeban-ramalingam/62/204/103" target="_blank">LinkedIn page</a>.
                    In my leisure time, I enjoy reading calculus, natural science, and computer science textbooks and viewing computer
                    science and physics videos on the MIT Open Courseware website. In other words, I LOVE to learn and expand my knowledge
                    in the field of mathematics and science. I also enjoy spending time with my amazing family. I have two loving parents
                    and two caring siblings. My younger brother currently attends Middle School and is a student of the Gifted-Talented Program.
                    My older brother will be completing his senior year at University of California Berkeley double-majoring in Electrical
                    Engineering and Computer Science. Lastly, I enjoy solving interesting computer science problems that I find online.
                    Upon graduating high school, I plan to pursue a double major in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.</p>
                <p> For the technical folk out there: The website's back-end is JAVA-based and is organized using the Spring
                    Model-View-Controller design pattern. Using REST-ful web techniques, I designed the overall communication logic
                    between the client and server in such a way that the client-side sends HTTP GET and POST requests via AJAX to the server,
                    which then returns a JSON response back to the client to be used for various purposes. Thus, there exists a meaningful
                    division (commonly referred to as the separation of concerns) between front-end presentation and back-end business logic
                    which are essentially linked by HTTP Request/Responses. The back-end communicates with a MySQL database using the JDBC
                    Adapter and uses Hibernate for Object/Relational Mapping of JAVA Object Models.</p>

            <p>I am also a senior at Centennial High School. Unfortunately I am not as academically talented as my partner in this project, but I am decently smart and
                have had the opportunity to take advantage of our schools resources and classes to fuel my success in the future. I am currently a Technology/Programming Intern
                at Idaho Digital Learning Academy and have been working there since June of 2012. For Idaho Digital Learning Academy, I have developed desktop Java-based applications,
                worked with Amazon AWS, and have undertaken learning new programming languages as requested. I have been a part of BPA since my Sophomore year of high school. I originally
                participated in only HTML and Web-based events, but in recent years I have expanded my skill set and can participate in a wider variety of competitions, though I only participated in this Web applications Competition.
                Unfortunately, I was not able to compete in the JAVA competition this year due to unforeseen calendar complications. I enjoy programming and all of it's challenges
                including solving the puzzles that come along the way. In college, I plan to Major in Computer Science and Minor in Mathematics and Japanese.
